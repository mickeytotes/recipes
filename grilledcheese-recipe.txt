Ingredients:

- Bread (preferably home-made)
- Cheese (muenster)
- Butter

Get a little butter on that bread. As much as you want. Butter is great.

Put some cheese on both pieces of bread. Honestly, put as much as you want. It's called grilled cheese after all. The bread is just the delivery system.

Using a toaster oven or conventional oven, grill that cheese. Just grill the cheese. Heat up the cheese that you put on the bread. When it's melted and browning, you've done it.

Using a cast iron skillet: You got this. I'm not going to tell you how to use a skillet, you're surely a proud person, with his or her own opinions about temperature and durations. Good luck to you.

Finally, eat the grilled cheese. Put those two suckers together, or eat it open face.

(optional: dip that grilled cheese in some tomato soup, like in the Campbell's commercial from the 90's. You know, the one where the kid has the tent set up in the back yard, so he feels like he's struck out on his own, but his mom still can make him all his meals. I tear up just thinking about it).
